## 📖 Story 
You start as a **girl at her last year of school** and you have a wardrobe with some old clothes and savings of X euros. Throughout the game you will be going to different events, an **your clothes will wear out**. You will have to make choices on what kind of clothes you are buying. **In the end you have to buy a prom dress, which beauty and style will be based on how much money you ended up with.** 

The goal of the game is to show that **if you buy fast fashion pieces**, because of their low lifespan, **you will end up spending more money**, than if you choose alternatives as high quality brands or second hand pieces.
